## Description:

Application is created based on multiply JS arrow functions and simple HTML code.

Allows to create basic **To-do List** by adding tasks in *"Dodaj nowe zadanie"* (Add new task) field and by pressing *"Dodaj zadanie"* (Add task) button - this will than create to-do list displayed below in *"Lista zadań"* (Task list) field.

It also allows to mark each task as **done** or to **remove** task from to-do list. 

Clicking on green button will ~~strike-through~~ task text and mark green button as "✔" ticked. To remove any required task from to-do list, user can choose red button marked with "🗑" trash bin.
