## Description:

Application is created based on multiply JS arrow functions and simple HTML code.

Allows to create basic **To-do List** by adding tasks in *"Dodaj nowe zadanie"* (Add new task) field and by pressing *"Dodaj zadanie"* (Add task) button - this will than create to-do list displayed below in *"Lista zada≈Ñ"* (Task list) field.

It also allows to mark each task as **done** or to **remove** task from to-do list. 

Clicking on green button will ~~strike-through~~ task text and mark green button as "‚úî" ticked. To remove any required task from to-do list, user can choose red button marked with "üóë" trash bin.

There are two new buttons added: *"Ukryj uko≈Ñczone"* (Hide Completed) and *"Zako≈Ñcz wszystko"* (Complete all).  

- *Ukryj uko≈Ñczone* button - function of this button is toggle between hide or to show done tasks. Depending on the current task list state, the button changes its name to "Ukryj" (hide) or "Poka≈º uko≈Ñczone" (show completed).

- *"Zako≈Ñcz wszystko"* - its function is to complete all tasks, and once this is done button becomes disabled.
