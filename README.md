## Description:

Application is created based on multiply JS arrow functions and simple HTML code.

Allows to create basic *to-do list* by adding tasks in the **taks field** and by pressing **"Dodaj zadanie"** (Add task) button - this will than create to-do list displayed below in **"Lista zada≈Ñ"** (Task list) field.

It also allows to mark each task as **done** or to **remove** task from to-do list. 

By clicking on green button, this will strike-through task text and mark green button as ticked. To remove any required task from to-do list, user can choose red button marked with bin.

### **Note:** 
Refreshing page will remove all recently added tasks and return page to start point - application is still being worked on.
